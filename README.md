# sorting

Some basic sorting algorithms implemented in Clojure. These sometime come up in conversations (interviews). 

- bubble
- selection
- insertion
- quicksort
- merge

## Usage

If you run -main with a number as a parameter you can get a feel for how fast each sort is.


Run all the sorts on a list of random integers [num].

$ lein run [num]
